# About Ping 
Ping is a networking utility used to test the connectivity between two devices on a network. It operates by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). The primary purpose of ping is to determine whether the target device is reachable and to measure the round-trip time for the signal (latency).

Key Functions of Ping:
1. Test Connectivity.
2. Measure Latency.
3. Troubleshoot Network Issues.

Now we can Check the Connectivity between Mysql Client and Mysql Server.
